# MACA Samples
This repository contains a collection of reference implementations of fundamental GPU programming patterns with MXMACA.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Getting the MACA Samples

Using git clone the repository of MACA Samples using the command below.
```
git clone .....
```

Without using git the easiest way to use these samples is to download the zip file containing the current version by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page. You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples.

### Building MACA Samples for Linux

The Linux samples are built using makefiles or CMakeLists. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make:
```
$ cd <sample_dir>
$ make
```
To use the CMakeLists, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run:
```
$ cd <sample_dir>
$ mkdir build && cd build 
$ cmake .. && make  
```

Validate that every buildable sample has a local README:

```shell
python3 scripts/check_sample_docs.py
```

Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page to copy this repository to your Gitee account.

2   Clone the course repository
On your local machine, use the git clone command to clone the forked repository of the course to your local environment:
```
mkdir <your-workspace>  && cd <your-workspace>
git clone ......
```

3   Create a new branch for development
Enter the directory of the cloned repository,Create a new branch (e.g., dev branch) for your creation or revision:
```
cd <your-workspace>
git checkout -b dev
```

4   Make modifications
Create or revise courses on your dev branch.After making modifications, add and commit your changes.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
```

5   Push for modification
Push your changes to your forked repository
```
git push origin dev
```

6   Create a Pull Request
Submit your changes to the original repository maintainer and request a merge.
```
• Go back to your Gitee/Github account and find the repository you forked.
• Click the "New Pull Request" button.
• Select the branch you pushed and compare it with the main branch of the original repository.
• Fill in the title and description of the PR, explaining the content of your modifications and the purpose.
• Click the "Create Pull Request" button to submit the PR.
```

7   Process feedback
The project maintenance team or maintainer will review your PR and may raise suggestions for changes or questions.
Make necessary modifications based on the feedback, and repeat steps 4 to 6 until the PR is accepted.
